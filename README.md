# Ao Cli

Ao Cli is used to authenticate programmatic access to our app and delegate those permissions to things such as node/js scripts.

## Setup

- Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14.x.y.  We use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node versions.

Test in command line
```
node -v
```

- Get libraries from AO contact.  You should receive `ao-lib-v...` and `ao-cli-v...`

- Install libraries
